# GPT Prompt Sequences for App Development

This repository contains a collection of effective prompts and prompt sequences for developing applications using GPTs. The prompts are organized into four categories: product management, software architecture, software engineering, and data engineering.

## Purpose

The purpose of this project is to provide developers and data scientists with a set of prompts and prompt sequences that have been proven to work well with GPT-based applications. By using these prompts, you can improve the quality and relevance of the text generated by your GPT models, resulting in more effective and efficient applications.

## Categories

The four categories of prompts are:

- Product management: prompts related to ideation, requirement gathering, user stories, and agile processes.
- Software architecture: prompts related to architectural patterns and style, modularity, quality attributes, and technical design documents.
- Software engineering: prompts related to requirements analysis, software design, testing and test-driven development (TDD), quality assurance, and project management.
- Data engineering: prompts related to data modelling, data integration, data storage, and workflow management.

Each category contains multiple prompts, and each prompt is provided as a Markdown file that includes the prompt sequence and an explanation of how to use it effectively.
